# Decoding a Decade: Temporal Analysis of India's Most Prominent News Topics

This project explores dominant societal themes and temporal trends in Indian news headlines over the last decade (2014â€“2023) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and topic modeling (LDA). It forms part of the final assignment for the Natural Language Processing course (Fall 2024).

## Repository Contents
- NLP_v1.ipynb: The main Jupyter Notebook containing the data preprocessing, topic modeling, and visualizations.
- Manjiri_Satam_NLP_Note_Final.pdf: The final research note outlining the background, methodology, results, and discussion.
- yearly_topic_summaries_10.csv: Clean CSV showing top 10 topics per year with word summaries and headline counts

## Research Motivation
Media headlines are condensed records of public discourse. This project analyzes over 3.5 million news headlines from the India News Headlines Dataset to understand:

- What dominant topics surfaced in Indian news between 2014 and 2023?
- How have these topics evolved over time in response to major societal events?
- What can we learn about public discourse and policy priorities in India?
